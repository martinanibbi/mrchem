 * @brief Ground state SCF and multi-configurational optimization with Lagrangian optimization
 *
 * This ground state solver performs a constraint optimization of the orbitals
 * where the constraint is the orthonormality of the orbitals.
 * The solver utilizes an external driver to compute the 1-2RDMs.

/*  Open questions:
    - Store orbitals separately or override the ones in molecule?
    - save solver as a private element?
    - store copy of integrals and rdms in new basis, or change the originals?
    - with molecular orbitals does it make sense to diagonalize the 1rdm?
    - change of basis is now split between External solver (integrals, rdms and lagrange multipliers) and LagrangianSolver (orbitals)
